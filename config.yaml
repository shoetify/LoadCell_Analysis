Parameter:
  #Use this if using the same wind tunnel. Note: 0hz has been set to 0m/s wind speed.
  WindSpeed_relationship: y=0.1726x-0.06956

  #The recording sample rate of the load cell. UNIT(Hz)
  Sample_rate: 1000

  #The following three parameter is to deside the stable time after and before the wind speed is change.
  #This parameter is to deside how many second of data were not used when the wind speed change(it start from 0Hz), UNIT(s).
  Stable_time_0Hz: 30
  #This parameter is to deside how many second of data were not used when the wind speed change(not start from 0Hz), UNIT(s).
  Stable_time_others: 10
  #This parameter is to deside how many second of data were not used before the wind speed change, UNIT(s).
